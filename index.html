    <p>Hello, my name is Liam Gilmartin. I am a senior at Universoty of Hartford.
      I am a cinema major. I'm from Southampton New York. I was born in Sacramento California
      and lived there during my early childhood. The reason I decided to take this class was because I
      had originally planned on minoring in Computer Science but decided against it after a few classes
      since it wasn't really my thing. I figured web design would be better for me since it offers more
      creativity.</p>
