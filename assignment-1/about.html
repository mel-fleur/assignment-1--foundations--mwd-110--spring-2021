         <h2>The Flying Birds</h2>
         <p>The Flying Birds is an idea that I recently started developing, with the goal of creating a similar quartet to The Four Freshmen. Our first meeting is going to be on Tuesday, March 3rd at 9:00 p.m. in the Hartt School. More than enough people have expressed interest in being a part of, or helping to create this group. So far, I have 5 people interested in going to the first meeting. One of them is a baritone, one a bass, two are tenor, and the last is interested in doing backup trombone. I am secretly hoping the less skilled tenor will still want to be a part of the backing jazz band as a pianist or drummer. I am excited to finally be apart of something like this, and even more excited to sing some of my favorite songs by The Four Freshmen!</p>
