         <p>As I said before, I'm Melody, a Junior at UHart, pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Communications! I plan on entering the field of television production, hoping to work in a production team as a writer, camera worker, or editor. But, I may find myself more in the range of news and journalism, or even film / cinema, depending on the types of connections I make!</p>
         <p>As of now, however, my main love is fiction, particularly the interactive kind: yep, video games! In my down time, that's generally what I'm doing, and I can even occasionally be found livestreaming them on Twitch. On my channel - though I don't stream often - I play a wide variety, from Final Fantasy XIV to Dragon Ball FighterZ, to something as niche as Stardew Valley!</p>
         <p>I can also be found semi-actively on Twitter! Where I post and share other posts about a wide variety of nerdy - and also serious - topics. Games, television and film, animation, art, occasionally politics and LGBT experiences and stories, along with comedy and memes! </p>
         <p> Links to both can be found in the "Content" page.</p>
