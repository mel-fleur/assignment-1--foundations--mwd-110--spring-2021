         <p>Jacquelyn Argondizza is a hardworking individual. When she sets goals she doesn't stop till her goal is achieved. Recently, Jacquelyn has shadowed a UX Designer at The Hartford. Although she is studying to be a Web Developer, she was able to see how UX Designer's and Web Developer's work together. Before going to college, Jacquelyn didn't take a ton of computer based courses. It was her Web Design, Advanded Web Design, Computer Applications, and Advanced Computer Applications classes in high school that made her realize her love for Web Design. She still has a lot to learn, but she is up for the challenge. </p>
         <p>Other than working with computers, Jacquelyn has worked at the Inn at Fox Hollow in Woodbury, New York for three years. She is a server and sometimes bartender over her school breaks. Jacquelyn Argondizza is an honors student at Hillyer College. This past winter she went on the Hillyer Honors Hawaii trip. She had a great time and got to experience the Native Hawaiian culture. Along with being an honors student, she is a Hillyer College Student Ambassador. She hosts student pannels and brings prospective students to lunch. The main goal is for Jacquelyn to convince future students to come to Hillyer College. When she's not working on the academic side of campus, Jacquelyn is a part of the Residential Hall Association. She is the Publicity Chair for Regents Park and Park River. There have been many flyers and posters that Jacquelyn has created for RPR's upcoming events. </p>
