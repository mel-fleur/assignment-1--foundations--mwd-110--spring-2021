      <p>Hello, my name is Liam Gilmartin. I am a senior at University of Hartford.
        I am a cinema major. I'm from Southampton New York. I was born in Sacramento California
        and lived there during my early childhood. The reason I decided to take this class was because I
        had originally planned on minoring in Computer Science but decided against it after a few classes
        since it wasn't really my thing. I figured web design would be better for me since it offers more
        creativity over traditional software development.</p>

        <p>For years now, photography has been one of my biggest hobbies. I got my first camera when I was
          thirteen years old. Most of my photos are landscape and wildlife photos. I've always loved finding
          new places and seeing new things. Although I have no plans on making a career out of it, I believe it
          will remain an important part of my life for years to come.</p>
